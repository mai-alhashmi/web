  <h3>World of Science</h3>
                <p>by Albert Newton</p>
                <p>Explore the wonders of the natural world.</p>
                It works to expand our awareness of what is around us and outside our planet.
                 For example, understanding the origin and development of the universe helps us
                  understand the physical and chemical phenomena of the universe. Throughout the ages, humans have been interested in phenomena related to the universe, such as sunrise and sunset, the succession of night and day, the succession of seasons, lunar and solar eclipses. As they observed the sky with its various stars, they gave the constellations different names related to the environment surrounding them, such as the constellations Taurus, Scorpio, Orion, Aries, the Great Bear and the Little Bear. They concluded the relationship between the appearance of these constellations and the seasons and the agricultural seasons associated with them. Most acts of worship in Islam are related to astronomical phenomena, such as prayer times, which are related to the apparent movement of the sun. The time for the dawn prayer begins from the appearance of the white twilight towards the east until sunrise, and the time for the noon prayer begins when the sun sets, that is, begins to decline after reaching its maximum height in the sky. The two acts of worship of fasting and Hajj are also related to the movement of the moon around the Earth. Traveling by sea between countries requires knowing the 
                directions, which is done by guiding by the stars.

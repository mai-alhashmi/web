            <p>It has evolved over the ages with various inventions such as
                paper and printing, and this development continues even in
                modern printing. The early history of books predates what is
                traditionally called “books” today, and begins with tablets,
                manuscripts, and papyrus. Then came the expensive and elaborate
                handwritten books. Printing opened the doors to the mass
                production of books, which eventually led to the dominance of
                mass-printed books today. Contemporary books may be devoid of
                physical existence with the advent of the e-book.

                Mechanical Technology:
                Mechanical technology is one of the simplest forms of
                technology, both in its application and in its design.
                Mechanical technology is the use of simple machines to solve
                problems. This includes the use of pulleys, levers, wheels
                and axles, wedges, inclined planes, and even cogs and gears.
                Mechanical technology is used for any task that involves
                doing mechanical work, which is primarily the motion of
                objects. Any machine, generator, or tool used to do work
                uses mechanical technology.

                water from dug wells.
